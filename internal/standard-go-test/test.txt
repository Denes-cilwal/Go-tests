- The testing.T type offers methods to control test execution,
        - such as running tests in parallel with Parallel(),
        - skipping tests with Skip(), and calling a test teardown function with Cleanup().


Errors and Logs

        -The testing.T type provides various practical tools to interact with the test workflow, including t.Errorf(),
        - which prints out an error message and sets the test as failed.

        - It is important to mention that t.Error* does not stop the execution of the test.
        - Instead, all encountered errors will be reported once the test is completed.
        - Sometimes it makes more sense to fail the execution; in that case, you should use t.Fatal*.
        - In some situations, using the Log*() function to print information during the test execution can be handy:
