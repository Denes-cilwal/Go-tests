Running Parallel Tests
By default, tests are run sequentially;
the method Parallel() signals that a test should be run in parallel.
All tests calling this function will be executed in parallel. go test handles parallel tests by pausing each test that calls t.Parallel(),
and then resuming them in parallel when all non-parallel tests have been completed.
The GOMAXPROCS environment defines how many tests can run in parallel at one time, and by default this number is equal to the number of CPUs.

Testify provides assert functions and mocks, which are similar to traditional testing frameworks, like JUnit for Java or Jasmine for Node.js.
Testify provides two packages, require and assert. The require package will stop execution if there is a test failure, which helps you fail fast.
assert lets you collect information, but accumulate the results of assertions

The output log also clearly indicates the difference between the actual output and the expected output.
Compared to Goâ€™s built-in testing package, the output is more readable, especially when the testing data is complicated,
such as with a long map or a complicated object. The log points out exactly which line is different, which can boost your productivity.
